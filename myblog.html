          <div class="content"><img src="images/content1.jpg" alt=""> Affleck plays a musician identified only as "C"; Rooney Mara plays "M," the woman who shares a Texas house with him until he's killed in a head-on collision. Rising from a table at the morgue, C shows up back at the place that held his happiest and most painful memories ... except now he's a ghost in a near-comical sheet with cut-out holes for eyes. He watches M grieve – she can't see him – and, a scene that seems to last forever (it's just four minutes), observes his rail-thin girlfriend gobbling down a pie until she vomits. C tries to embrace his lady love in her bed; she can't feel his touch. When another man enters her life and kisses her in the doorway, C knocks books off shelves.

          <div class="content"><img src="images/content3.jpg" alt="">That's the movie. No action. No budget. No special effects. Oh, C does wave to a ghost he spots haunting the house next store, and he keeps trying to dig into a wall to find something M left there. But there's no conflict. The Transformers crowd, hoping for violence or horror, will bolt for the exits in the face of such nonstop stasis – Lowery's influences run more to Terence Malick and Thai master Apichatpong Weerasethakul than Michael Bay.
